      <h2>Climate Initiative Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Archipelago is a collaborative network of organisations focused on shared innovation, governance, and resource optimisation.
        Member organisations work together on cross-industry projects, exchanging knowledge and creating standards that benefit all participants.
      </p>

      <p>
       The Climate Initiative goal is simple.  <br>
        <strong>Slow down the global temperature increase, by reducing the CO2 emissions, providing alternative energy sources. </strong>
        Our governance structure ensures that all members have a voice, while a neutral operator facilitates coordination and compliance across all initiatives.
        Each project is tracked through metrics dashboards to measure efficiency, engagement, and outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Participation in the initiative allows organisations to access shared services, reduce duplication, and participate in joint ventures with reduced risk.
        Members benefit from collaboration, transparency, and access to insights that would be challenging to develop independently.
      </p>
      <p>Climate Initiative started off with four countries, US, Russia, China and India.  
        The goal was clear, and the quickest win was to reduce the use of the fossil fuel powered factories, profoundly. </p>

      <p>China have made significant progress, but are only in Year One of a five year strategy. 
        One approach is to ramp down dependence on oil, and ramp up renewables and other more sustainable energy options.</p>

      <p>Six months, from when the Climate Initiative was started, there is sight of the Paris Agreement being met.  
        This is a major winning outcome. 
        Studies of people displaced due to climate change is showing that it is mainly due to the temperature rise.
      So meeting the Paris Agreement, will prevent further climate change displacement in other countries.</p>
