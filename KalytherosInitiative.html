      <h2>Kalyteros Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Archipelago Consortium is a collaborative network of organisations focused on shared innovation, governance, and resource optimisation.
        Member organisations work together on cross-industry projects, exchanging knowledge and creating standards that benefit all participants.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our governance structure ensures that all members have a voice, while a neutral operator facilitates coordination and compliance across all initiatives.
        Each project is tracked through metrics dashboards to measure efficiency, engagement, and outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Participation in the consortium allows organisations to access shared services, reduce duplication, and participate in joint ventures with reduced risk.
        Members benefit from collaboration, transparency, and access to insights that would be challenging to develop independently.
