    <h2>Who is involved?</h2>

    <p>
      Aruna Sandhya Koya founded the Archipelago ideals and brought together
      the Archipelago Counsel to resolve international issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Archipelago Counsel brings us together when we can’t see past
      differences in opinion or culture. We stand with respect, and we talk.
      Teams include crisis response, dispute resolution with international
      trade lawyers, and guardians.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside the Archipelago Community, companies participate in initiatives
      to provide a collaborative and lucrative marketplace.

    <p>
      <strong>Archipelago Constitution</strong> — respect for boundaries.
      Every owner has a right to their property. A legal foundation.
